# Deck: Minecraft playing cards

Deck is a resource pack with playing cards for Minecraft!

This pack makes uses of [Custom Roleplay Data](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/custom-roleplay-data-datapack)

## How to use:

1. Make sure you enable the server resource pack in the server selection menu!
2. Hold a piece of paper for cards or iron nuggets for poker chips
3. Type the following command, replacing <id> with the card/chip number:
   `/trigger CustomModelData set <id>`
4. If you want, you can rename the cards/chips too.

Cards are numbers 2-53. Yeah, I don't know why I didn't start at 1 but I'm not changing it
anymore. The poker chips are numbered from 2 to 6, in order: white, blue, red, green, black.
